# Game Description
* In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen.  
* The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar.  
* When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen.  
* The player shoots and destroys the aliens.  
* If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet.  
* If any alien hits the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship.  
* If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
