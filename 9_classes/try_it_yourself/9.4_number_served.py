"""
Problem:
Start with your program from Exercise 9-1. Add an attribute called number_served 
with a default value of 0. Create an instance called restaurant from this class. 
Print the number of customers the restaurant has served, and then change this 
value and print it again.
Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number of 
customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number and print 
the value again.
Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment the number 
of customers whoâ€™ve been served. Call this method with any number you like that
could represent how many customers were served in, say, a day of business.
