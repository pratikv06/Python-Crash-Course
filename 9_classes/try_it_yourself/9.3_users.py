"""
Problem:
Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name and last_name, 
and then create several other attributes that are typically stored in a user 
profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary of the 
userâ€™s information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints a 
personalized greeting to the user.
Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods 
for each user.
