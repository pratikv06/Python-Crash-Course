Problem:
A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on  a personâ€™s age. 
If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are  between 3 
and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. 
Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of 
their movie ticket.
