Problem:
Use a dictionary to store people’s favorite numbers. Think of five names, and 
use them as keys in your dictionary. Think of a favorite number for each person, 
and store each as a value in your dictionary. Print each person’s name and 
their favorite number. For even more fun, poll a few friends and get some 
actual data for your program.
