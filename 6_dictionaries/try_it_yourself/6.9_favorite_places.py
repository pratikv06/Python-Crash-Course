Problem:
Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three names to use as keys 
in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places for each person. To 
make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends to name a few of 
their favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and print each personâ€™s 
name and their favorite places.
