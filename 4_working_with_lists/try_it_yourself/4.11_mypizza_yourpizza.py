Problem:
Start with your program from Exercise 4-1. Make a copy of the list of pizzas, 
and call it friend_pizzas.
Then, do the following:
> Add a new pizza to the original list.
> Add a different pizza to the list friend_pizzas.
> Prove that you have two separate lists. Print the message, My favorite pizzas 
  are:, and then use a for loop to print the first list. Print the message, My 
  friendâ€™s favorite pizzas are:, and then use a for loop to print the second list.
  Make sure each new pizza is stored in the appropriate list.
